# Elasticsearch Basics

## What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is an open-source, distributed search and analytics engine designed to handle large volumes of data, providing near-real-time search capabilities.

## Technical Details

### 1. Programming Language

Elasticsearch is primarily written in **Java**.

### 2. Initial Release

The initial release of Elasticsearch was in **2010**.

### 3. Founder

Elasticsearch was founded by **Shay Banon** to address the limitations of existing search technologies.

### 4. License

Elasticsearch is released under the **Apache License, Version 2.0**, making it open source and free to use.

### 5. Architecture

- Elasticsearch follows a distributed, multi-tenant architecture.
- It uses a master-node architecture with data nodes and client nodes.
- Master nodes manage the cluster, while data nodes store and retrieve data.

### 6. Data Storage

Elasticsearch stores data in a structure called **JSON-like documents**, which are stored in **indices**.

### 7. Query Language

Elasticsearch Query DSL (Domain Specific Language) is used for querying data. It supports a wide range of queries, including full-text queries, term queries, and more.

### 8. Transport Protocol

Elasticsearch nodes communicate with each other and with clients using the **HTTP/RESTful API** over TCP.

### 9. Clustering

- Elasticsearch clusters consist of multiple nodes that work together.
- It uses a distributed system approach for scalability and fault tolerance.

### 10. Indexing and Sharding

- Data is divided into **indices**, and each index can be split into **shards** for horizontal scaling.
- Shards can have **replicas** for redundancy and high availability.

### 11. Plugins

Elasticsearch has a modular design, and functionality can be extended through **plugins**. There are various community-contributed plugins and official plugins provided by Elastic.

### 12. Ecosystem

Elasticsearch is a part of the **Elastic Stack (ELK Stack)**, which includes Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. It is commonly used for log analytics, full-text search, and other data analysis tasks.

### 13. Community and Support

Elasticsearch has a strong and active **open-source community**. There is official documentation, forums, and community support available.

### 14. Updates and Versioning

Elasticsearch regularly releases new versions with improvements, bug fixes, and new features. Users can choose to deploy the version that best fits their requirements.

### 15. Integration

Elasticsearch can be integrated with various data sources, applications, and visualization tools.
