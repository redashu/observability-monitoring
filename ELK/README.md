# Elasticsearch Basics

## What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is an open-source, distributed search and analytics engine designed to handle large volumes of data, providing near-real-time search capabilities.

## Use Cases

- **Search Engine:** Core component for websites and applications.
- **Log and Event Data Analysis:** Ideal for storing, searching, and analyzing large volumes of log and event data.
- **Full-Text Search:** Powerful capabilities for applications requiring advanced full-text search.

## Document-Oriented

- Data stored in JSON-like documents.
- Each document is a collection of fields with specific data types.

## Index

- A collection of documents with similar characteristics.
- Represents a data record.

## Node

- An instance of Elasticsearch running on a machine.
- Multiple nodes form a cluster for distributed systems.

## Cluster

- A collection of nodes working together, sharing data and workload.
- Provides scalability, fault tolerance, and load distribution.

## Shards

- Each index is divided into multiple shards.
- Sharding improves performance and scalability.

## Replicas

- Each shard can have zero or more replicas.
- Replicas provide redundancy and enhance system resilience.

## RESTful API

- Elasticsearch exposes a RESTful API for easy interaction using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## Query DSL

- Powerful Query DSL for defining complex queries, matching criteria, and performing aggregations.

## Scalability

- Horizontally scalable; additional nodes handle increased data and query loads.

## Aggregations

- Supports aggregations for extracting statistical information from data.

## Security

- Authentication, authorization, and encryption for data protection and access control.

## Logstash and Kibana

- Logstash for log processing.
- Kibana for data visualization.

## Community and Ecosystem

- Vibrant open-source community.
- Extensive ecosystem of plugins and integrations.
